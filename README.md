# Chinglish
Have you ever tried learning to speak Chinese? Furthermore, have you ever tried learning how to read Chinese?

Me personally, I study the characters, and 10 minutes later I struggle to remember what they mean. Chinglish is a typing game, written in Javascript, to memorize chinese characters!

Chinglish utilizes the Javascript MEAN stack, with technologies including:

MongoDB
Express
AngularJS
NodeJS
Socket.io

The file structure is laid out with all the JS server related code in the Server folder, and all the Javascript partials, Angular controllers and factories in the public folder. 

On the User's Dashboard page, there is a table of characters for the user to memorize, as well as a leaderboard with the top
10 scores.

In the game, the User chooses a difficulty based on speed, and when the game begins, the characters fall from the top of the screen 
and the user must remember what they learned. Once 5 characters hit the bottom without successful translation, the user gets a game
over.

Users can also chat with each other to talk about whatever they want, including Chinese!

** COMING SOON, MULTIPLAYER using Socket.io **
